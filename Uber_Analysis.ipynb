        "This project focuses on analyzing the supply-demand imbalance faced by Uber, particularly in the route from the airport to the city. The primary objective was to identify when and why there is a gap between rider demand and cab availability. Through detailed examination of data patterns and rider behavior, several important insights and recommendations were developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis clearly shows that Uber experiences a significant mismatch between supply and demand during the Night and Early Morning time slots. This issue is especially noticeable when passengers try to book rides from the airport heading toward the city. In these time periods, either very few cabs are available, or riders face high cancellation rates by drivers, creating a major inconvenience for customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "One key factor contributing to this problem is the lack of cabs during the night hours. Many Uber drivers are not active during these late hours, which causes customers to frequently receive messages saying that no cabs are available. This results in a poor customer experience and lost business for Uber. On the other hand, during early morning and morning time slots, the issue is mainly due to driver cancellations. Even when cabs are technically available, many drivers choose to cancel rides, especially if the trip is not profitable or convenient for them. This further widens the supply-demand gap and affects rider trust in the platform."
